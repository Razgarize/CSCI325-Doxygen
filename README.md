# Employees and Supervisors

These contain classes called Employees and Supervisors. Contains a main.cpp that tests these classes. Also includes autogenerated documentation thanks to DoxyGen.

Supervisors also get an evilness value. Because we know they want to feel superior to their peers.

Any documentation of the project can be found under
